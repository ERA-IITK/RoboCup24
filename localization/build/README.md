## Variable Definitions

- `CXX`: This variable defines the C++ compiler to be used, which is `g++` in this case.
- `CXXFLAGS`: These are the compiler flags and options. It includes `-std=c++11`, which specifies C++11 standard compliance, and `-Wall`, which enables all warning messages. You can add or modify compiler flags here.
- `TARGET`: This variable specifies the name of the target executable, which is `meaning` in this case.
- `SRCS`: This variable lists the source code files required to build the target. In this case, it contains `meaning.cpp`.

## Automatic Dependency Generation

- `OBJS`: This variable is generated from `SRCS` and represents the object files that will be created during compilation. It uses a pattern substitution to replace `.cpp` extensions with `.o`.

## Build Rules

- `$(TARGET): $(OBJS)`: This rule specifies how to build the target executable (`meaning`) from the object files (`$(OBJS)`). It uses `$(CXX)` to compile and link the object files into the executable.

- `%.o: %.cpp`: This is a generic rule for building object files (`%.o`) from corresponding C++ source files (`%.cpp`). It uses `$(CXX)` to compile each source file into an object file. The `$<` represents the source file, and `$@` represents the target (object file).

## Clean Rule

- `clean`: This rule specifies how to clean up the project. It removes the object files and the target executable to keep the directory clean. You can run `make clean` to execute this rule.

To build the `meaning` executable, you can simply run `make`. It will compile `meaning.cpp` into `meaning.o` and then link `meaning.o` into the `meaning` executable using the specified compiler and flags. To clean up the project, you can run `make clean`, which will remove the object files and the `meaning` executable.
